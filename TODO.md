# TODO

## Documentation
- [ ] Tidy up README.md - remove the detailed "Crate structure" section that duplicates information and will become stale. Keep it focused on quick start, examples, and high-level concepts.

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks comparing JS vs WASM validation speed
- [ ] Add bundle size comparison (JS vs WASM)
- [ ] Support more example schemas (arrays of objects, recursive structures, etc.)
- [ ] Add CI check to ensure demo examples stay in sync with schemas
