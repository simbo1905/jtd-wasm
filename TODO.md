# TODO

## Documentation
- [ ] Tidy up README.md - remove the detailed "Crate structure" section that duplicates information and will become stale. Keep it focused on quick start, examples, and high-level concepts.
- [x] Review and fix formatting on GitHub release page (release/0.1.0)
- [x] Update CI release workflow to generate better formatted release notes
- [x] Manually fix existing release formatting with `gh release edit`

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks comparing JS vs WASM validation speed
- [ ] Add bundle size comparison (JS vs WASM)
- [ ] Support more example schemas (arrays of objects, recursive structures, etc.)
- [ ] Add CI check to ensure demo examples stay in sync with schemas
